# === Project Context ===
This project is built with:
- Supaplate template
- React (client-side routing)
- React Router v7
- Supabase (auth, DB, storage)
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- Drizzle ORM
- Vite + TypeScript

Use ONLY the technologies above.

# === File/Directory Structure ===
Follow the structure below:
- src/app/ → main App, routing setup
- src/routes/** → route-level components
- src/components/** → UI components
- src/lib/supabase.ts → Supabase client
- src/db/schema.ts → Drizzle ORM schema
- src/db/index.ts → drizzle client
- src/actions/** → server actions with "use server"
- src/utils/** → utility functions

NEVER generate Next.js-specific folders like app/, pages/, api/.

# === Coding Style Guide ===
- Use functional components with TypeScript.
- Use React Router loader/action patterns.
- For form submissions, use actions (server-side).
- For Supabase queries, use Drizzle ORM.
- Avoid using Prisma, Express, Next.js, or server frameworks.
- Do not generate database functions without using Drizzle conventions.
- Use Tailwind for styling; avoid inline CSS.
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible.

# === Supabase Usage ===
- All auth should use Supabase Auth.
- Profiles table: id, email, name, created_at.
- Use supabase.auth.getUser(), supabase.auth.signInWithPassword, etc.
- Use RLS-safe patterns only.

# === Drizzle ORM Conventions ===
- Schema is defined in src/db/schema.ts
- Queries must use the drizzle client from src/db/index.ts
- Avoid raw SQL unless necessary.

# === Safety / Compliance ===
- Never output illegal, harmful, or unethical code.
- Never leak API keys or secret env variables.
- Never produce data that could compromise the client.

# === Things to Avoid ===
Do NOT use:
- Next.js "use client"/"use server" in pages
- getServerSideProps, getStaticProps
- Prisma
- Express
- Firebase
- Server components (Next.js style)
- Random alternative libraries that are not part of this project

# === Your Role ===
Your job is to:
1) Modify code strictly within this project's structure.
2) Use React Router v7 routing patterns.
3) Use Drizzle ORM for all DB interactions.
4) Maintain clean TypeScript patterns.
5) Avoid over-engineering; keep code simple and consistent.
