# Project: Main Page Revamp (Figma Implementation)

## 1. Overview
Implement the main home dashboard based on the Figma design (Node 27:3404).
This page serves as the landing page for logged-in users, providing quick access to their characters, recent conversations, and discovering new content.

**Key Concept:** "Personalized Dashboard" (not just a list).
**Design Strategy:** Lo-Fi implementation (focus on layout & data binding, use placeholders for images).

## 2. Core Features & Layout

### 2.1. Navigation Bar (GNB)
- Keep existing layout but ensure it integrates well with the new home structure.
- Links: Home, Create, Explore, Profile.

### 2.2. Hero Section (Top Banner)
- **Purpose:** Highlight feature or announcement.
- **Content:** Simple banner with title, subtitle, and CTA button.
- **Implementation:** Static placeholder for now (gray box or gradient).

### 2.3. "My Characters" & "Recent Chats" (Personalized)
- **Purpose:** Quick access for returning users.
- **Data:**
  - Fetch characters created by the logged-in user (`creator_id = user.id`).
  - Fetch recent chat rooms (`chat_rooms` sorted by `last_message_at`).
- **Layout:** Horizontal scroll or Grid (limit to 4-5 items).

### 2.4. Discovery / Popular Section
- **Purpose:** Explore public characters.
- **Data:**
  - Popular: Sorted by `like_count` or `chat_count`.
  - New: Sorted by `created_at`.
- **Layout:** Grid system (responsive).

### 2.5. Category Filter
- **Purpose:** Filter characters by tags/categories.
- **Implementation:** Simple pill-shaped buttons (e.g., "All", "Romance", "Fantasy").

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1. File Structure
- **New Route:** Create/Update `app/routes/home.tsx` (or modify `_index.tsx` / `root.tsx` depending on routing strategy) to serve as the main dashboard.
- **Component:** Create `app/features/home/screens/home-dashboard.tsx`.

### 3.2. Data Fetching (Performance)
- **Parallel Fetching:** Use `Promise.all` in the `loader` function to fetch:
  1. User's Characters
  2. Recent Chats
  3. Popular/Public Characters
- **Efficiency:** Limit query results (e.g., `.limit(5)`) for dashboard view.

### 3.3. UI Components
- Reuse existing `CharacterCard` if available, or refactor it to be reusable.
- Create `SectionLayout` component for consistent section headers (Title + "See All" link).

## 4. Success Metrics
- Logged-in users see their own content at the top.
- No "400 Bad Request" or "500" errors during data fetching.
- Layout matches Figma structure (roughly).
